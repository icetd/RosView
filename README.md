### Why not use ros environment on windows

```
1. I donâ€™t want to make my windows development environment look untidy by configuring the ros environment.
2. In order to make it more convenient to use on other machines
```

### Why not Qt

```
Qt is very convenient, but it's slot functions lose performance for wider compatibility.
```
